# Data-analysis-on-OLA


# 1) Project Overview:
   
This project involves an in-depth analysis of ride-hailing data from July 2024, aiming to extract valuable insights that can inform operational strategies and improve user experience. The dataset includes information on booking statuses, vehicle types, payment methods, customer and driver ratings, cancellation reasons, and ride distances. By examining these factors, the project seeks to understand booking patterns, customer behavior, and revenue distribution within the specified timeframe.

   # 5) Insights from the Data:
       Ride Volumes and Success Rates:
       Over 62% of rides were successfully completed, while ~18% were canceled by drivers, ~10% by customers, and ~10% due to the driver being unavailable.
       
       Revenue and Payment Methods:
       Most revenue was generated via Cash (18.67M), followed by UPI (13.75M). Payment methods like Credit and Debit Cards contributed relatively less, with a significant share marked as "Unknown."

       Top Vehicle Types by Distance:
       The top-performing vehicle types in terms of total distance covered were:
       Prime Sedan
       eBike
       Bike
       
       Average Customer Ratings by Vehicle Type:
       Prime Plus vehicles received the highest customer ratings (4.00), while eBike had the lowest (3.99).
       Ride Cancellation Reasons:

      Customers cited reasons like "Driver is not moving towards pickup location" (3,084 cases) and "Driver asked to cancel" (2,584 cases).
      Drivers most frequently canceled due to "Personal & Car related issues" (6,355 cases).
      
      Rating Patterns:
      Driver and customer ratings are weakly correlated (-0.004), indicating almost no linear relationship between how drivers rate customers and vice versa.

      Distribution of Booking Value:
      The average booking value was ₹548, with a wide range (min: ₹100, max: ₹2,999).
      
      Ride Distance Analysis:
      The median ride distance was around 8 km, with 75% of rides being shorter than 27 km

# 6) Final Conclusion:
    The analysis highlights the efficiency and revenue contributions of different vehicle types, payment methods, and customer preferences. While most rides are successful, improving the availability of drivers 
    and reducing cancellations can significantly enhance user experience. Focusing on the highest-rated vehicle types (e.g., Prime Plus) and incentivizing digital payment methods like UPI could increase both c 
    Customer satisfaction and revenue. Further studies could explore segmentation and trends in cancellations to refine service strategies. ​
